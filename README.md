Project predicting the rainfall in australia using machine learning algorithms.

models used - K nearest neighbour 
            , support vector machine
            , logistic and linear regression
            , decesion trees

evaluation metrics used - Mean absolute error
                        , Mean square error
                        , R2_score
                        , jaccard index
                        , f1_score
                        , accuracy_score
                        , log_loss

review the project for errors and other improvements, 
sugest better models/methods/algorithms through python code that can be used to obtain a better prediction/accuracy ouput
